### Day 7: Broken Authentication 🛡️  

Authentication mechanisms are the gatekeepers of web applications, ensuring that only authorized users gain access. However, if implemented poorly, they can lead to **Broken Authentication**, exposing sensitive data or allowing attackers to impersonate users. Here's everything I explored on Day 7:

## 🔍 **What is Broken Authentication?**  
**Broken Authentication** occurs when flaws in the authentication process allow attackers to bypass login systems, steal credentials, or impersonate users.  

Common causes:  
1. Weak or easily guessable passwords.  
2. Poor session management.  
3. Insufficient protection against brute force attacks.  
4. Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## 🚩 **How to Identify Broken Authentication**  

### 🧪 **Testing for Vulnerabilities**  
1. **Brute Force Attack**: Attempt login with a list of commonly used passwords.  
2. **Session Hijacking**: Check if the session token is easily guessable or reusable.  
3. **Credential Stuffing**: Use leaked username/password pairs to test access.  
4. **Logout Behavior**: Ensure sessions are invalidated after logout.  

### 🔧 **Tools to Use**  
- **Burp Suite**: Intercept login requests and analyze responses.  
- **Hydra/Medusa**: Perform brute force testing.  
- **OWASP ZAP**: Automate authentication vulnerability checks.  
- **Hashcat/John the Ripper**: Test password hashes for weaknesses.

## 🛠️ **Hands-on Example**  

### Example 1: Login Form Vulnerability  
1. Test weak passwords like `admin`, `123456`, `password`.  
2. Observe if the application allows login without enforcing strong password policies.  

### Example 2: Session Fixation  
1. Log in and observe the session ID.  
2. Test if the session ID remains the same before and after login.

## 🔒 **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Enforce Strong Password Policies**: Require complex passwords and periodic updates.  
2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add an extra layer of security.  
3. **Rate-Limiting**: Restrict the number of login attempts.  
4. **Session Security**: Regenerate session IDs after login and enforce session timeouts.  
5. **Secure Storage**: Hash and salt passwords using algorithms like `bcrypt` or `PBKDF2`.

## 🌟 **Why This Matters**  
Broken Authentication vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access. Ensuring robust authentication mechanisms protects both users and organizations.
