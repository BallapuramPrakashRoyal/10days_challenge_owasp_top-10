### 🔐 **Day 6: Sensitive Data Exposure**  

Sensitive Data Exposure is a critical vulnerability that occurs when an application inadvertently exposes sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal data, due to improper security practices.

## 📖 **What You’ll Learn**  
1. **Overview**: Understand the concept of sensitive data exposure.  
2. **Attack Scenarios**: Explore real-world examples and how attackers exploit this vulnerability.  
3. **Detection**: Learn tools and techniques to identify weak spots.  
4. **Mitigation**: Implement best practices to secure sensitive data.

## 🔍 **What is Sensitive Data Exposure?**  
It happens when applications fail to adequately protect sensitive information during storage or transmission. This could be due to:  
- Lack of encryption.  
- Using outdated cryptographic algorithms.  
- Insufficient access control.  

---

## 🔓 **Real-World Scenarios**  
1. **Insecure Transmission**: Data transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS.  
2. **Weak Encryption**: Using outdated algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1.  
3. **Exposure via Logs**: Sensitive information logged in plain text.  
4. **Database Misconfiguration**: Lack of encryption for stored sensitive data.

## 🛠️ **How to Identify Sensitive Data Exposure**  

### **1. Inspect Data in Transit**  
- Use tools like **Wireshark** or **Burp Suite** to capture and analyze traffic.  
- Look for unencrypted sensitive data (e.g., credentials, credit card numbers).  

### **2. Analyze Stored Data**  
- Check if sensitive information is stored in plaintext in databases, files, or logs.  

### **3. Evaluate Cryptography**  
- Assess the use of outdated or weak encryption algorithms.

## 🔧 **Tools to Assist You**  
- **Wireshark**: To inspect network traffic for unencrypted data.  
- **Burp Suite**: To intercept and analyze HTTP requests.  
- **Nmap**: To detect outdated protocols.  
- **Cryptool**: To analyze and test cryptographic implementations.  

---

## 🔒 **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Enforce Encryption**:  
   - Use HTTPS for all communications.  
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit with strong algorithms (e.g., AES-256).  

2. **Secure Key Management**:  
   - Store keys securely using hardware security modules (HSMs).  

3. **Avoid Sensitive Data Storage**:  
   - Do not store unnecessary sensitive information.  
   - Regularly purge data no longer needed.  

4. **Use Strong Hashing**:  
   - Replace MD5 or SHA-1 with SHA-256 or bcrypt for password hashing.  

5. **Test Regularly**:  
   - Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability scans frequently.  

---

## 🛡️ **Best Practices**  
- Implement TLS (Transport Layer Security) for secure communication.  
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in application code.  
- Use secure coding frameworks and libraries.  
- Enable Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent data leaks through XSS.  

---

## 📖 **Hands-On Practice**  
- Test for sensitive data exposure in applications using OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite.  
- Practice scenarios on platforms like OWASP Juice Shop and PortSwigger Web Security Academy.
